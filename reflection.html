            An important concept of web design is Responsive Design. Through research on the web, I learned that it is a concept in which 
            a website is designed to <span class="italic">respond</span> to the capabilities and needs of the user/device. My research also 
            showed that this concept was first defined by Ethan Marcotte (web.dev, May 2020). It terms of website behaviour, Responsive Design means that the 
            layout of a page changes accoring to the size and orientation of a display. By using Responsive Design, a web page can be displayed 
            on desktops, mobile phones, and tablets without distortion of the content and preserving readability in all cases. By adding the 
            attribute name with value "viewport" and an attribute content with value "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", the content can 
            be properly scaled to the screen. "viewport" sets the viewport so that the content attribute can work. The "device-width" makes 
            the page match the screen width of the device and the "initial-scale=1" makes it so that 1 pixel in CSS matches 1 device independent 
            pixel (web.dev, May 2020). CSS is the main way to design a web page so that it is responsive. Instead of using exact sizes like px, a relative size 
            should be used for the dimensions like width and height. An example is using a percent in the width of an element. If it is 50%, 
            the width of the element will be 50% of its container. If the whole document is styled like this, then the width of the content 
            will adjust automatically to the size of the screen. CSS provides further layout methods like flexbox, where the content is 
            adjusted automatically to fit despite differing sizes, grid, where a grid can be created to place content exactly where needed and 
            column, where the content is displayed in columns. There is also the CSS @media feature that can query the device specifications
            like display width, pointer style, etc. This can allow us to set breakpoints at certain screen sizes so that a more proper layout 
            can be used in certain cases where the original layout is insufficient for that size. CSS is very powerful and allows us to implement 
            the useful concept of Responsive Design. <br> <br>

            During this course, I have learned about the basics of web programming. Web programming consists of three fundamental technologies, 
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML or HyperText Markup Language is a way to create content for a web page by just using a text document. 
            HTML allows text and media to be displayed on the page and it also has information about the page. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is 
            a way to style the display of the webpage. It allows elements within the page to adjusted based on their size, layout, color and 
            many more ways. Styling can be done as attributes of individual elements, or it can be placed within style tags to modify the whole 
            document. A separate .css file can also contain this styling and the advantage is that it can be used to make multiple pages share 
            the same styling, as long as a link element contains a reference to it. However, HTML is only static and CSS has limited runtime 
            capabilities, so to have a page modify itself during runtime, JavaScript is needed. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming 
            language that is interpreted. However, the syntax is similar to C so the familiarity with C made it easier to learn about. 
            JavaScript is run by the browser and can query and modify the HTML document. The link between HTML, CSS and JavaScript is through 
            the framework of DOM or document object model. The HTML document is represented by a DOM tree, where each element is considered a node.
            DOM allows JavaScript and CSS to understand how to find the elements in the HTML document. Elements can be considered objects in 
            JavaScript, which makes it easy to manipulate them in that language. Overall, this course has taught me alot about web programming. 
            I went from knowing nothing about making a website to being able to create a functioning web page with styling and dynamic functioning.
